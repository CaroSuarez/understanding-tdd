// CSV Kata
// Task:
// Your team has an urgent requirement: You need to dump Customer
// ojects (as per an existing customer class) to disk in CSV format.
// This is to provide the data to a nightly job that will import them
// into the CRM system.
// * There is no need to include headers
// * No need to cater for commas in the data
// * No need to check for existing files/data
// Rules:
// 1. Build this using TDD
// 2. Keep SOLID principles in mind
// 3. Use the provided Customer class
// 4. When unit testing, you must not write to disk; intead, use a
// test double to check what is written to the CSVFileWriter
